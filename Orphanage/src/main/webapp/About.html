    <h3><b>About Orphans Situation</b></h3>
    <p><b>Many orphan children in India are also at risk of malnutrition or are already suffering from it given that most orphans are not in shelters and orphanages. <br>
        Most orphan children in India do not have access to necessities like food, shelter, and clean water, which also leads to a lack of education. <br>
        Another major problem in India is access to healthcare services, specifically for orphans.  <br>
        With an almost equal number of couples who want a child and children who need a home, you'd think that adoption rates would be much higher, but due to the complicated adoption process and skewed views of adoption as a whole, most children are left to fend for themselves.<br>  
        With so few children actually in care homes, most orphans are not available for legal adoption. <br>
        There have been reports of parents attempting to sell their children because they can no longer provide for them. <br> </b></p>
